 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.0.0 (upgraded to new major version due to changes in naming mechanisms)
 |
 |
 |-- vLIB naming mechanisms
 |    as of 3.0.0 all vLIB class will start with vlib (lower case), i.e. vTemplate will now be vlibTemplate.
 |    This is to avoid confusion with other classes which use similar names.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate, new Global Context Variable
 |    with the options TIME_PARSE and GLOBAL_CONTEXT_VARS both set to 1, a global variable called
 |    __PARSE_TIME__ (2 underscores either side) will be set with the time taken to parse the template.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibMimeMail new class
 |    a new class to help with sending MIME encoded email with attachements, HTML mail, priority
 |    setting and more. Please see the documentation.
 |
 |
 |-- documentation
 |    added new documentation for vlibMimeMail.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplateCache bug fix
 |    bug reported by vscope in the forums which caused a problem with the caching due to the fact that
 |    when PHP is installed as a CGI on Win32 or on IIS and possibly other server, the $PHP_SELF variable
 |    includes the entire path to the executable, then to the script.
 |    We now use $PATH_INFO if it's available, as it is in CGI and IIS but not as apache module, or $PHP_SELF
 |    otherwise.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibDate new class
 |    a new class for manipulating dates outside of the 1970-2038 32-bit date range.
 |    This class supports dates between 0001 and 9999 and has many functions to manipulate the date
 |    and the way it's displayed. Please see the documentation.
 |
 |
 |-- documentation
 |    added new documentation for vlibDate.
 |
 |
 |-- examples
 |    restructured the examples directory and added examples for vlibMimeMail and vlibDate.
 |    It is now possible to view the source of the examples whilst browsing.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.0.2
 |
 |
 |-- vTemplate performance
 |    made a 'MINOR' change to main pcre call which boosts performance by up to 80%.
 |
 |
 |-- vTemplate performance
 |    changed way in which vTemplate reads files into a var using fopen, fread, fclose
 |    instead of implode(file()). Overall performace changes are minimal but this way of
 |    reading the data is up to 30% faster.
 |

 |-- Released vLIB.
